	* tests/: added top level subdirectory, to be used for unit tests.
	The idea in putting the code here is that you can do 'setup.py test'
	during installation to make sure everything is working correctly.
	The test code would normally *not* be callable from the installed
	module. 

	* tests/*_test.py: moved from src/Test*.py

	* setup.py: updated version number.

2011-02-13  Richard Murray  <murray@sumatra.local>

	* src/*.py: added svn:keywords Id properly

	* src/matlab.py (ngrid): added ngrid() from v0.3d

	* src/freqplot.py (nichols_grid, closed_loop_contours, m_circles,
	n_circles): copied over changes from Allan McInnes in v0.3d; ngrid()
	functiality + split out some of the nichols chart code into separate
	functions

2011-02-12  Richard Murray  <murray@sumatra.local>

	* setup.py: updated version number to 0.4a

2010-11-05  Richard Murray  <murray@sumatra.local>

	* external/yottalab.py: New file containing Roberto Bucher's control
	library functions.  OK to start pulling these into the main library,
	with attribution, but note that they use modifications of the
	default library => some rewrites will be needed.

2010-09-11  Richard Murray  <murray@sumatra.local>

	* src/matlab.py (step): Added local step response function that uses
	lsim2() instead of signal.step (which can't handle integrators).
	This function may not be needed when new scipy step2() function is
	available.
	(impulse): Added local impulse response function that sets the
	initial condition based on the input matrix and then uses the
	lsim2() function to compute the response.

	* examples/test-response.py: Added test script for making sure that
	time repsonse functions are working as desired

	* src/matlab.py (lsim): Added local version of lsim that calls
	signal.lsim2 (actual ODE integrator)

2010-09-06  Richard Murray  <murray@sumatra.local>

	* src/statefbk.py (ctrb): new function for testing controllability
	* src/statefbk.py (obsv): new function for testing observabiilty

2010-09-02  Richard Murray  <murray@sumatra.local>

	* src/statefbk.py (place): Use np.size() instead of len() for
	finding length of placed_eigs for better compatability with
	different python versions [courtesy of Roberto Bucher]

	* src/delay.py (pade): New file for delay-based computations +
	initial implementation of pade() [courtesy Sawyer Fuller]

2010-06-17  Richard Murray  <murray@sumatra.local>

	* src/rlocus.py: changed num, den to nump, denp for clarity
	* src/rlocus.py: new file with Ryan Krauss's root locus code

2010-06-06  Richard Murray  <murray@sumatra.local>

	* examples/pvtol-lqr.py: Added example to test out LQR routines

	* src/matlab.py (bode): created a wrapper that allows MATLAB style
	arguments for bode (eg, bode(sys1, sys2))

	* src/ctrlutil.py (issys): added new function to check if an object
	is a system (state space or transfer function).  Will generalize
	this latter to look for other compatible classes.

	* src/freqplot.py (bode): Compute frequency range of bode plot based
	on poles and zeros
	(bode): Allow bode plot to be passed a list (or tuple) as the first
	argument, in which case multiple bode plots are generated

	* src/statesp.py (StateSpace.zeros): new function to compute zeros
	for a state space system
	(StateSpace): defined new functions to compute poles of a state
	space system

	* src/xferfcn.py (TransferFunction): defined new functions to
	compute poles and zeros of a transfer function.

2010-05-31  Richard Murray  <murray@sumatra.local>

	* src/exception.py (ControlNotImplemented): added new exception, to
	be used for functions that are not yet implemented

	* src/statefbk.py (lqr): added lqr function (using slycot).  Still
	needs to be verified to make sure calculations are correct.

	* ChangeLog: converted to standard GNU formation (old style below)
	* setup.py: updated package number to v0.3, changed URL to
	sourceforge wiki

------------------	
31 May 2010, RMM: added place() function using slycot
  * New module: statefbk - functions to design state feedback controllers
  * Uses Enrico Avventi slycot wrappers (http://github.com/avventi/Slycot)
  * Also added some exception types: ControlSlycot and ControlDimension
  * Added new example to test slycot interface (directly)

29 May 2010, RMM: updated function documentation
  * Added __doc__ strings for all current functions
  * Added __doc__ string to matlab module, listing control toolbox functions

22 May 2010, RMM: tweaked comments and released v0.3a
  * Changed copyright information on modified files to 2010
  * Updated "to do" comments to use "#! TODO:" as prefix

11 Feb 2010, GR: implemented and tested state space feedback

4 Jan 2010, GR: updated bode plots
  * made bode plot more like matlab
  * added options for plotting in dB, Hz

27 Dec 2009, GR: important bug fix: feedback TFs were being divided by two
  
10 Oct 09, RMM: reset matplotlib import in secord-matlab
  * Using 'from matplotlib import *' causes error with figures
  * On my other computer, got error when trying to import 'matplotlib.pyplot'
  * Need to sort out versions and figure out proper import structure

13 Sep 09, RMM: added basic state space functionality
  * Updated StateSpace routines to allow BD algebra with constants
  * Updated pvtol-nested example to try to use state space representation
    (not completely working yet)

12 Sep 09, RMM: code restructuring for transfer functions
  * Implemented feedback() method in bldalg; partially working
    for mixture of TF, SS and numbers (not thoroughly tested yet)
  * New feedback method for TransferFunctions
  * Updated gangof4 to use new feedback function

9 Sep 09, RMM: updated pzmap to generate a plot (turn off with Plot=False)

8 Sep 09, RMM: rewrite of xferfcn to handle type casting better
  * Appropriate functions now call convertToTransferFunction
  * Restricted transfer function to SISO only

7 Sep 09, RMM: additional fixes
  * Implemented block diagram operations for SISO transfer functions
  * Modified frequency response functions for transfer functions
  * Added rudimentary pole/zero computations
  * Added comments on things that need to be fixed (search for !)

5 Sep 09, RMM: updates to get standard examples working
  * Copied and converted pvtol_nested.py from AM08, Chapter 11
  * Updated freqresp to use poly1d for computing values
  * Added outputs to bode plot - return mag and phase subplot handles

2009-05-24  Richard Murray  <murray@kona-2.local>
  * ./ Initial creation of package files and ChangeLog
  * Using simpler text format since emacs python mode doesn't support
    ChangeLog entries anyway
