2011-04-02  Richard Murray  <murray@malabar.local>

	* src/__init__.py: removed import of tests module (moved to tests/)

	* src/matlab.py: Added hsvd, balred, modred to list of functions
	that are imported for use as is.  Updated documentation string to
	indicate that these are implemented, along with a few other
	functions (zero, lqr) that weren't properly listed.

	* src/modelsimp.py (balred): Removed extraneous print statements
	(modred): Set method to be 'matchdc' by default (to match MATLAB)

	* src/__init__.py: added missing import of modelsimp functions

	* tests/slycot_convert_test.py (TestSlycot.testTF): turned off print
	statements in unit test to make it easier to see results.  Use
	verbose=True to turn back on.

	* tests/convert_test.py (TestConvert.testConvert): got rid of print
	statements in unittest; clutters the output so that you can't see
	the errors clearly.  Use verbose=True to turn back on.

	* src/statesp.py (_convertToStateSpace): removed "buggy" print
	statements 

	* src/xferfcn.py (_convertToTransferFunction): removed "buggy" print
	statements 

	* tests/nichols_test.py (TestStateSpace.testNgrid): updated testcode
	to turn off grid in initial Nichols chart plot.

	* src/freqplot.py: updated comments at top of file to reflect
	nichols chart move

	* src/nichols.py: transferred over changes from v0.3d

	* src/matlab.py (ngrid): moved import to function

2011-03-31  Richard Murray  <murray@malabar.local>

	* examples/pvtol-nested.py: updated stability margin plot to use
	proper calling format for bode().

	* src/statesp.py (_convertToStateSpace): moved slycot import
	to the location where it is actually needed (allows running some
	commands without slycot installed)

	* src/xferfcn.py (_convertToTransferFunction): moved slycot import
	to the location where it is actually needed (allows running some
	commands without slycot installed)

	* src/nichols.py: new file for Nichols plot routines; move
	nichols(), nichols_grid(), closed_loop_contours(), m_circles(),
	n_circles()

	* src/__init__.py, src/freqresp.py, src/matlab.py: updated to match
	new file structure for Nichols charts

	* src/nichols.py (nichols): updated processing of freqresp to take
	into account the fact that return arguments are now a matrix of
	results (even for a SISO system)

2011-03-30  Richard Murray  <murray@malabar.local>

	* tests/: added top level subdirectory, to be used for unit tests.
	The idea in putting the code here is that you can do 'setup.py test'
	during installation to make sure everything is working correctly.
	The test code would normally *not* be callable from the installed
	module. 

	* tests/*_test.py: moved from src/Test*.py

	* setup.py: updated version number.

2011-02-13  Richard Murray  <murray@sumatra.local>

	* src/*.py: added svn:keywords Id properly

	* src/matlab.py (ngrid): added ngrid() from v0.3d

	* src/freqplot.py (nichols_grid, closed_loop_contours, m_circles,
	n_circles): copied over changes from Allan McInnes in v0.3d; ngrid()
	functiality + split out some of the nichols chart code into separate
	functions

2011-02-12  Richard Murray  <murray@sumatra.local>

	* setup.py: updated version number to 0.4a

2010-11-05  Richard Murray  <murray@sumatra.local>

	* external/yottalab.py: New file containing Roberto Bucher's control
	library functions.  OK to start pulling these into the main library,
	with attribution, but note that they use modifications of the
	default library => some rewrites will be needed.

2010-09-11  Richard Murray  <murray@sumatra.local>

	* src/matlab.py (step): Added local step response function that uses
	lsim2() instead of signal.step (which can't handle integrators).
	This function may not be needed when new scipy step2() function is
	available.
	(impulse): Added local impulse response function that sets the
	initial condition based on the input matrix and then uses the
	lsim2() function to compute the response.

	* examples/test-response.py: Added test script for making sure that
	time repsonse functions are working as desired

	* src/matlab.py (lsim): Added local version of lsim that calls
	signal.lsim2 (actual ODE integrator)

2010-09-06  Richard Murray  <murray@sumatra.local>

	* src/statefbk.py (ctrb): new function for testing controllability
	* src/statefbk.py (obsv): new function for testing observabiilty

2010-09-02  Richard Murray  <murray@sumatra.local>

	* src/statefbk.py (place): Use np.size() instead of len() for
	finding length of placed_eigs for better compatability with
	different python versions [courtesy of Roberto Bucher]

	* src/delay.py (pade): New file for delay-based computations +
	initial implementation of pade() [courtesy Sawyer Fuller]

2010-06-17  Richard Murray  <murray@sumatra.local>

	* src/rlocus.py: changed num, den to nump, denp for clarity
	* src/rlocus.py: new file with Ryan Krauss's root locus code

2010-06-06  Richard Murray  <murray@sumatra.local>

	* examples/pvtol-lqr.py: Added example to test out LQR routines

	* src/matlab.py (bode): created a wrapper that allows MATLAB style
	arguments for bode (eg, bode(sys1, sys2))

	* src/ctrlutil.py (issys): added new function to check if an object
	is a system (state space or transfer function).  Will generalize
	this latter to look for other compatible classes.

	* src/freqplot.py (bode): Compute frequency range of bode plot based
	on poles and zeros
	(bode): Allow bode plot to be passed a list (or tuple) as the first
	argument, in which case multiple bode plots are generated

	* src/statesp.py (StateSpace.zeros): new function to compute zeros
	for a state space system
	(StateSpace): defined new functions to compute poles of a state
	space system

	* src/xferfcn.py (TransferFunction): defined new functions to
	compute poles and zeros of a transfer function.

2010-05-31  Richard Murray  <murray@sumatra.local>

	* src/exception.py (ControlNotImplemented): added new exception, to
	be used for functions that are not yet implemented

	* src/statefbk.py (lqr): added lqr function (using slycot).  Still
	needs to be verified to make sure calculations are correct.

	* ChangeLog: converted to standard GNU formation (old style below)
	* setup.py: updated package number to v0.3, changed URL to
	sourceforge wiki
