\section{\module{control}}
This is some information on the control module.

\section{Differences from MATLAB}
\begin{itemize}
  \item You must include commas in vectors.  So [1 2 3] must be [1, 2, 3].
  \item Functions that return multiple arguments use tuples
  \item Can't use braces for collections; use tuples instead
  \item Transfer functions are only implemented for SISO systems (due
  to limitations in the underlying signals.lti class); use state space
  representations for MIMO systems.
\end{itemize}
