Welcome to the Python-Control project.
This is sample documentation and will include our Princeton University APC524 contribution.

We can incorporate any existing documentation as well. For example from R.Murray's earlier tex document:

Differences from MATLAB
-----------------------
*  You must include commas in vectors.  So [1 2 3] must be [1, 2, 3].
*  Functions that return multiple arguments use tuples
*  Can't use braces for collections; use tuples instead
*  Transfer functions are only implemented for SISO systems (due to limitations in the underlying signals.lti class); use state space representations for MIMO systems.
