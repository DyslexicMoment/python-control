List of Pending changes for control-python
RMM, 5 Sep 09

Examples and test cases
  * Figure out how to import 'figure' command properly (version issue?)

TransferFunction class fixes
  * evalfr is not working (num, den stored as ndarrays, not poly1ds)

Block diagram algebra fixes
  * Implement state space block diagram algebra
  * Produce minimal realizations to avoid later errors

State space class fixes
  * Convert pvtol to state space systems and rerun example
  * Implement pzmap for state space systems

LTI updates
  * Try to get control.matlab.step semantics to be closer to MATLAB

Basic functions to be added
  * margin - compute gain and phase margin (no plot)
  * lqr - compute optimal feedback gains (use SLICOT SB02ND.f)
  * lqe - compute optimal feedback gains (use SLICOT SB02ND.f)
  * lyap - solve Lyapunov equation (use SLICOT SB03MD.f)
  * See http://www.slicot.org/shared/libindex.html for list of functions
